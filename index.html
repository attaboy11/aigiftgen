        <h2>Why Solar &amp; Battery Storage Makes Sense in Kent</h2>
        <div class="two-col">
          <div>
            <p>
              Kent gets more usable sunlight than most people expect – and with current electricity prices, solar panels with battery storage can often pay for themselves in a few years. Instead of sending cheap daytime energy back to the grid, you store it and use it in the evening when prices are highest.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the right system, you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cut your electricity bills significantly</li>
              <li>Reduce your dependence on energy price rises</li>
              <li>Keep more of the energy you generate</li>
              <li>Increase the appeal of your home to future buyers</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              BrightGrid Kent connects homeowners with vetted local installers who can design and fit a system tailored to your property and budget. You get clear information, realistic expectations, and local support.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-list">
          <details>
            <summary>Is solar really worth it in the UK climate?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes, especially in the South East. Modern panels work with daylight, not just direct sun. With current energy prices, many systems in Kent see payback periods in the range of several years, depending on usage and system size.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do I need a battery, or can I just get panels?</summary>
            <p>
              You can do panels only, but a battery lets you store excess energy and use it later in the evening or overnight, increasing your self-consumption and potential savings.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How much does a typical system cost?</summary>
            <p>
              Costs vary depending on roof size, access, and system design, but most residential packages fall somewhere in the mid four to low five-figure range. A proper quote is the only way to know for sure.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you install the systems yourselves?</summary>
            <p>
              No – we work with a small network of trusted local installers across Kent. We help you find suitable options and understand your choices.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What if I’m not ready yet?</summary>
            <p>
              That’s fine. You can still request an assessment to understand your options. There’s no obligation to proceed.
